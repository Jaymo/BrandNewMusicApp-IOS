# BrandNewMusicApp-IOS
IOS version of a project I have been working on for a while. Its called BNM and is used to share newly created music. The project is a music player
that will allows user to preview a song once and if they like it they can purcahse it on Itunes (Via a web redirect)

The main features are:

1. User registration  and login

2. View featured artists  set from the web module

3. Follow/Un-follow artists and genres

4. View Followed artists and genres

5. Stream uploaded music

6. View top 10 music tracks (votes gathered from recommendations per week)

7. Recommend track (counts as a single vote for the track)

8. Notification for new song by artist followed
